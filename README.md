# Washington DC Metro Train Sign
This project contains the source code to create your own Washington DC Metro sign. It was written using CircuitPython targeting the [Adafruit Matrix Portal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4745) and is optimized for 64x32 RGB LED matrices.

# How To
## Hardware
- An [Adafruit Matrix Portal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4745) - $24.99
- Two **64x32 RGB LED matrix** compatible with the _Matrix Portal_ - $39.99 _to_ $84.99 
    - [64x32 RGB LED Matrix - 3mm pitch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2279)
    - [64x32 RGB LED Matrix - 4mm pitch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2278)
    - [64x32 RGB LED Matrix - 5mm pitch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2277)
    - [64x32 RGB LED Matrix - 6mm pitch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2276)
- A **USB-C power supply** (15w phone adapters should work fine for this code, but the panels can theoretically pull 20w if every pixel is on white)
- A **USB-C cable** that can connect your computer/power supply to the board

## Tools
- A small phillips head screwdriver
- Tape _(optional)_

## Part 1: Prepare the Board
1. Lightly screw in the phillips head screws into the posts on the _Matrix Portal_. These only need to go down about 60% of the way.

2. Using the power cable provided with 64x32 matrix, slide the prong for the **red power cable** between the post and the screw on the port labeled **5v**. Tighten down this screw all the way using your screwdriver. Repeat the same for the **black power cable** and the **GND** port.

3. Connect the _Matrix Portal_ to the large connector on the left-hand side of the back of the 64x32 matrix.

4. Plug in the power connectors to both displays(might need to splice the wires, so they can reach both displays).

5. You can use masking tape (or painter's tape) to prevent the cables from flopping around.

## Part 2: Loading the Software
1. Connect the board to your computer using a USB C cable. Double click the button on the board labeled _RESET_. The board should mount onto your computer as a storage volume, most likely named _MATRIXBOOT_.
    
    ![Matrix Connected via USB](img/usb-connected.jpg)

2. Flash your _Matrix Portal_ with the latest release of CircuitPython 6.
    - Drag the _.uf2_ file provided here into the root of the _MATRIXBOOT_ volume.
    - The board will automatically flash the version of CircuitPython and remount as _CIRCUITPY_.
    - If something goes wrong, refer to the [Adafruit Documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-m4/install-circuitpython).

3. Decompress the _lib.zip_ file from this repository into the root of the _CIRCUITPY_ volume. There should be one folder named _lib_, with a plethora of files underneath. You can delete _lib.zip_ from the _CIRCUITPY_ volume, as it's no longer needed.

    - It has been reported that this step may fail ([Issue #2](https://github.com/metro-sign/dc-metro/issues/2)), most likely due to the storage on the Matrix Portal not being able to handle the decompression. If this happens, unzip the _lib.zip_ file on your computer, and copy the _lib_ folder to the Matrix Portal. Command line tools could also be used if the above doesn't work.

4. Copy all of the Python files from _src_ in this repository into the root of the _CIRCUITPY_ volume.

5. The board should now light up with a loading screen, but we've still got some work to do.

## Part 3: Getting a WMATA API Key
1. Create a WMATA developer account on [WMATA's Developer Website](https://developer.wmata.com/signup/).
2. After your account is created, add the _Default Tier_ subscription to your account on [this page](https://developer.wmata.com/products/5475f1b0031f590f380924fe).
3. After doing this, you will be redirected to [your profile](https://developer.wmata.com/developer).
4. Under the _Subscriptions_ section on your profile, select the **show** button beside the _Primary Key_. This is the key that allows the board to communicate with WMATA.

## Part 4: Getting an OpenWeather Key
1. Create an OpenWeather account on [OpenWeather Dev Website](https://home.openweathermap.org/)
2. Once register you should receive and email with your API key

## Part 5: Configuring the Board
1. Open the [secrets.py](src/config.py) file located in the root of the _CIRCUITPY_ volume.
2. Fill in your WiFi SSID and password under the **Network Configuration** section.
3. Fill in your OpenWeather key in [secrets.py](src/config.py)
4. Fill in you WMMATA key in [secrets.py](src/config.py)
5. Under the **Metro Configuration** section:
    1. Select your station and lines from the [Metro Station Codes table](#dc-metro-station-codes), and set the _metro_station_code_ value to the corresponding value in the table.
    2. For _train_group_, the value needs to be either **'1'** or **'2'** or  **'3'**. This determines which platform's arrival times will be displayed. These typically fall in line with the values provided in the [Train Group table](#train-group-explanations), although single tracking and other events can cause these to change.
    3. Set the _metro_api_key_ value to the API key you got from [Part 3](#part-3-getting-a-wmata-api-key).
6. At the end, the first part of your configuration file should look similar this:

5. After you save this file, your board should refresh and connect to WMATA.

## Troubleshooting
If something goes wrong, take a peek at the [Adafruit Documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-m4). Additionally, you can connect to the board using a serial connection to gain access to its logging.
